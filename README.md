## What this app does

A user can create an account, create and delete his own trips when logged into the app.
A user without an account can look at the list of trips and see the detail of a selected trip.

## The features I want to implement

[] Allow a user to update a trip
[] Allow a user to update his profile
[] Implement the Stops features: every Trip can have stops.
[] Upload a picture for the trip
[] Add a list of activities in the trip and stops
[] Form validation
[] Refactor to remove Semantic UI
